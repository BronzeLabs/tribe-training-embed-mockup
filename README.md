# Tribe Training Embed Mockup

A sample website which demonstrates how to embed Tribe courses into your website.

### 1. Allow Course Embedding

Open the course in the Tribe Portal and allow embedding. This must be set to true before a course can be displayed in an iframe.

### 2. Add IFRAME to Page

```html
<iframe
  id="iframe"
  src="https://tribeproject.org/courses-details?id=ID_OF_COURSE&embed=true"
></iframe>
```

### 3. Add JavaScript

Add the JavaScript in **script.js** to your page. This code will enhance the user experience by removing scrollbars and improving scrolling.
